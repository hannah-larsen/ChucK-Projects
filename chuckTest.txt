Things I want to be able to manipulate:
- Chord type
- Osc type
- 


To do:
- call 'sporks' to have predefined params for changing every cycle
(have a clock function and trigger after 1 bar of notes)

have a while true loop and break when trigger number is typed
other numbers will be associated with certain sporks
